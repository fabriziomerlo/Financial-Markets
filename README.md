# Project of Financial Markets
In finance exist different strategies and methodologies based on a specific set of parameters, 
that are implemented to understand the past performance aiming to predict future trends. 
The analysis is focused on using these set of parameters and some combination of them with specific ratios, to build tilted portfolios and to compare the performance they record, in order to understand which of them can overperform the overall market. 
The assessment will be carried out on 7 different portfolios that compound single or multiple combinations of the measures, with different rebalancing granularity and number of stocks embedded in the portfolios.
